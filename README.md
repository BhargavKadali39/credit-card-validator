Details:

You and Fredrick are good friends. Yesterday, Fredrick received N credit cards from ABCD Bank. He wants to verify whether his credit card numbers are valid or not.<br>You happen to be great at regex so he is asking for your help!
A valid credit card from ABCD Bank has the following characteristics:

* It must start with a 4, 5 or 6.
* It must contain exactly 16 digits.
* It must only consist of digits (0-9).
* It may have digits in groups of 4, separated by one hyphen "-".
* It must **NOT** use any other separator like ' ' , '_', etc.
* It must **NOT** have  or more consecutive repeated digits.
Valid Examples:

    4424424424442444
    5122-2368-7954-3214

InValid Examples:

        42536258796157867       #17 digits in card number → Invalid 
        4424444424442444        #Consecutive digits are repeating 4 or more times → Invalid
        5122-2368-7954 - 3214   #Separators other than '-' are used → Invalid
        44244x4424442444        #Contains non digit characters → Invalid
        0525362587961578        #Doesn't start with 4, 5 or 6 → Invalid
